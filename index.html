      <p>If you're seeking a Full Stack Developer, keep reading....</p>   
      <p>I am currently enrolled in the Coding Boot Camp at UNC Charlotte.
      /p>
          
      <p> The Coding Boot Camp is developed by Trilogy Education Services and taught through 
          UNC Charlote Extension. 
      </p>
      <p> The curriculum includes front-end and back-end technologies through a dynamic full-stack curriculum, 
          including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, React.js, Node.js, C#, .Net, Database Theory, 
          Bookshelf.js, MongoDB, MySQL, Command Line, as well as Git.
      </p>        
      <p> An important feature of the Coding Boot Camp is that we work together with our peers to tackle 
          complex projects and get hands-on training through experiential learning opportunities with employers.
      </p>    
      <p> The highlight of the Coding Boot Camp is that we take our new skills to the next level on challenging problems, 
          building a portfolio of apps and projects to showcase our knowledge.
      </p>
      <p> The best way to learn more about how I am able to contribute solutions to your Full Stack Developer needs is to
